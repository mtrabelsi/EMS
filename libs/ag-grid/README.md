Contributing
==============

I am not looking for contributors for this project. If you have ideas, feel free to
get in touch and let me know. Or if you want to suggest something, feel free to
create a pull request with your ideas.

My reason for not looking for contributors is that this grid is my hobby,
something I work on in my spare time and enjoy. The design is something of a passion,
and I'm bringing the grid into a particular direction. To take on contributors
would require overhead of organisation, as well as agreeing direction (both
technical implementation and functional requirements).

If you would like to help, then where I actually do need help is in answering questions
on the forum and spreading the word to grow the user community.
